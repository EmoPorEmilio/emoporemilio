      <h2>About me</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Design Engineer</h3>
        <p>
          Hi there! I am a software engineer focused on developing products from
          Montevideo, Uruguay.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over 6 years of professional experience and a lifelong (pretty
          much literally) passion for software development, I have honed skills
          in the frontend domain, with a special proficiency in
          <strong>Javascript and Typescript</strong>. Beyond coding, my skills
          encompass the entire software engineering process, from specification
          and design to monitoring and troubleshooting deployed applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          While frontend development is a familiar territory for me, my current
          focus is on <strong>UI/UX design</strong>, which has been my hobby since I was a kid.
          Agile methodologies like <strong>Scrum and Kanban</strong> are second nature, having navigated
          diverse development environments with <strong>Git/Git-Flow</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          What truly drives me is the thrill of solving problems and decoding
          the unexpected challenges of software features. Admittedly, repetitive
          tasks arenâ€™t my forte, but my commitment lies in the bigger picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, I value transparent communication and mutual respect in any
          workspace. My diverse experiences, from teaching and customer support
          to live-streaming, have honed my ability to be a collaborative team
          member, always eager to learn, teach, and assist.
        </p>

          <em> 07/2022 - 07/2024</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In Mercadopago my job was to bridge the gap between the native
          application and the backend services. I've worked mainly with
          <strong>Typescript and NodeJS</strong>, and also dabbled in
          <strong>Groovy on Rails</strong> and <strong>Go</strong>.

        <h3>
          <strong>Senior Web UI Developer</strong> @ Globant (Contractor for
          Latam Airlines)
        </h3>
        <p>
          <em> 07/2020 - 07/2022</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew the most in my time at Globant, where I started as a
          Semi-Senior Web UI Developer and ended up as Senior Web UI Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked mainly with NextJS, both leading the development of the
          frontend experience as well as designing a backend-for-frontend able
          to provide the data needed for the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I gathered requirements from the client, designed the architecture of
          the frontend application alongside a teammate and mentored several
          junior developers.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> @ Ark</h3>
        <p>
          <em> 04/2020 - 07/2020</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I designed and developed an MVP for a startup aiming to provide a
          managing service for construction companies. I used
          <strong>Vue</strong> for the frontend and
          <strong>Express (NodeJS)</strong> for the backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          As my first professional experience designing a system by myself, it
          was not without its challenges. I had to learn a lot about requirement
          gathering and project management.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Frontend Developer</strong> @ Smartway</h3>
        <p>
          <em> 08/2019 - 04/2020</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In Smartway I started as a junior frontend developer, being lead by
          one senior developer who had developed the whole system.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a company focused on delivering real-time telemetry, the product I
          worked on was a dashboard for the clients to see their data. It was
          entirely written on <strong>VueJS</strong> with
          <strong>Vuex</strong> for State Management and included work with
          <strong>Google Maps API</strong> and <strong>Highcharts</strong> for
          visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the lead developer left, I was responsible for the whole frontend
          product development by myself, which was a really big challenge. I
          decided to leave once the compensation didn't grow along with the
          responsibilities.

        </p>
        <p>
          As my first full-stack developer experience, I landed on a
          graphics-oriented software factory startup, and boy did I learn a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I implemented new features, and reworked some preexistent ones in
          around 5 projects in diverse technologies, including
          <strong>Wordpress</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>,
          <strong>Vue</strong> and <strong>React</strong> for the frontend and
          <strong>PHP</strong>-<strong>MySQL</strong> and
          <strong>NodeJS-MongoDB</strong> for the backend.
        </p>
        <p>I was laid off as the company closed its operation.</p>

        <p>
          As my first IT experience, I was eager to develop software but found
          myself in a BA's team, in which I learned a lot but was overall
          unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for sending out emails to stakeholders, organizing
          meetings, and taking notes. I was also responsible for writing
          documentation for our processes.
